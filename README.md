# TensorTract
## Description
The TensorTract (TT) tool is a tractography utility to study axonal tracts in mouse whole brain images.

Currently, the tool compute the first-order partial derivatives of 3D-images to evaluate the Tensor at each point of the image. The output of this code will be integrated with tracotgraphy anlysis frameworks such as "TrackVis".

### Partial Derivative
In the above example, the first-order partial derivatives of 3D-image in the XY direction and at the appropriate spatial scale, reveals the orientation of "alveus tracts" of the hippocampus in a fluorescent  transgenic mouse (Thy1-eYFP).
